We report the identification of TIC 22888126 (Gaia DR3 5947829831449229312) as a dwarf nova candidate based on archival TESS photometry.

**Coordinates (J2000):** RA = 17:55:28.37, Dec = -47:35:34.1  
**Galactic:** l = 344.75 deg, b = -11.04 deg

The object is catalogued in VSX as a generic variable ("VAR") with period P = 0.0398 d (57.3 min) but was not previously classified. It is detected in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey but absent from SIMBAD and major CV catalogs.

**TESS Observations:** We extracted FFI aperture photometry from Sectors 13, 39, 66, and 93. Sector 13 (2019 July 18-August 14) captured an outburst with the following properties:

- Amplitude: ~2.5 mag (flux ratio ~10x)
- Rise time: <1 day
- Decline time: ~5-7 days
- Quiescent magnitude: G = 16.58

The light curve morphology (rapid rise followed by exponential-like decline) is consistent with dwarf nova disk instability outbursts.

**Classification:** The combination of: (1) outburst amplitude and timescale consistent with dwarf novae, (2) X-ray detection suggesting accretion, and (3) ultra-short period below the CV period gap (~75-115 min), strongly supports classification as a dwarf nova candidate. The 57.3-min period would place this among rare systems with degenerate donors.

**Follow-up Recommended:** Optical spectroscopy to confirm CV nature via emission lines (H-alpha, He II) and radial velocity monitoring to verify the orbital period.

This object was identified through machine learning (Isolation Forest) anomaly detection applied to Gaia DR3 light curve statistics.
